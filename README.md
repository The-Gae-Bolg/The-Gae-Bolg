# 👋 Hi, I'm Juan Pablo Rodriguez Barajas

I'm a **front-end web developer** with over 4 years of experience crafting modern, functional, and responsive web applications. Currently, I’m part of the **KIUBIX** team, where I contribute to the design and development of innovative digital solutions.

At **KIUBIX**, I’ve specialized in creating e-learning tools for platforms like Kernit and Moodle, working extensively with the SCORM 1.2 standard. One of my most impactful contributions has been leading the development of a custom system for interactive slides using SVG and JavaScript. This solution not only improved user engagement but also resolved compatibility issues in Safari, helping the company expand its reach.

Beyond e-learning, I’ve tackled a wide range of web projects. I’ve built WordPress sites featuring landing pages, galleries, online stores, and pre-sale ticket systems. I also led the development of internal platforms using Laravel 10+ and Vite, managing everything from payment integration and user authentication to cron jobs, email dispatch, and real-time alerts via webhooks—all with a strong focus on responsive design.
